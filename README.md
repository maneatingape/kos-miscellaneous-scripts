# Description

Collection of miscellaneous [kOS](https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/) scripts for the game [Kerbal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/), covering diverse topics such as [PID controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller), [orbital mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements) and [vector math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector).

Published under the permissive MIT license, so feel free to use the content of the scripts either directly or as inspiration. The scripts were written for kOS version 1.2.0 or later but may work on earlier versions.

# Scripts

## [around_v1.ks](https://github.com/maneatingape/kos-miscellaneous-scripts/blob/master/around_v1.ks)

Created for the [Around the World in 80 minutes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/190374-around-the-world-in-80-minutes-original-done/) challenge. [Video of entry](https://vimeo.com/382757485)

This script flies a plane westwards at a constant height and speed, then lands it on the KSC runway. PID loops are used to control the plane's speed, direction and altitude.

As the plane is intended to travel at faster than orbital velocity, it flips upside down once high enough. The craft then uses negative lift from its wings to counteract the excess radial acceleration.

A nifty trick is that altitude is not controlled directly by a single PID loop but rather by using 2 nested PID loops, the inner loop controlling the vertical speed of the craft. This allows quite precise control of altitude (the craft only overshoots by ~1%) and also allows tuning of maximum safe ascent and descent angles.

## [around_v2.ks](https://github.com/maneatingape/kos-miscellaneous-scripts/blob/master/around_v2.ks)

Created for the [Race Around The World](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/192495-race-around-the-world/) challenge. [Video of entry](https://vimeo.com/406980090)

Derived from the `around_v1` script, the key differences are:
* Tuned vertical speed PID constants to match different craft dynamics
* Eliminated the yaw PID loop, instead using a simple heading
* Some extra logic to drop empty stages

## [compass.ks](https://github.com/maneatingape/kos-miscellaneous-scripts/blob/master/compass.ks)

Functions that convert from raw ship vectors to compass values that match the in-game navball. Namespaced for convenience, to use simply call the lexicon members e.g. `compass:pitch()`

## [hover.ks](https://github.com/maneatingape/kos-miscellaneous-scripts/blob/master/hover.ks)

Very simple example of using nested PID controllers to maintain the height of a craft at a constant altitude.

## [kepler.ks](https://github.com/maneatingape/kos-miscellaneous-scripts/blob/master/kepler.ks)

Solves Kepler's problem to determine the position of a body orbiting another parent body with classical Newtonian mechanics. Given the traditional 6 Keplerian orbital elements and a time offet, it returns Cartesian orbital state vectors (x,y,z components for position and velocity) where the origin is the center of mass of the parent body.

Based on the steps in the memorandum ["Keplerian Orbit Elements -> Cartesian State Vectors"](https://downloads.rene-schwarz.com/download/M001-Keplerian_Orbit_Elements_to_Cartesian_State_Vectors.pdf) by Ren√© Schwarz

Key simplifying differences:
* Eccentric anomaly is used to determine position, instead of true anomaly
* kOS provides built in support for vector rotations, so we can compose rotations without needing to use trignometric functions directly.
* The equations in this algorithm expect radians, so variants of the trignometric functions that use radians are imported from the `util.ks` file, namespaced with `trig`.

*There is no practical reason to use this code in your own kOS scripts.* The built-in `positionat` and `velocityat` functions in kOS do the same thing but are much faster, as they use KSP's own code. This script is written for fun and to understand orbital mechanics better.

## [util.ks](https://github.com/maneatingape/kos-miscellaneous-scripts/blob/master/util.ks)

Utility functions called by the `kepler.ks` script:
* Regular trignometric functions that use radians instead of degrees along with hyperbolic variants.
* Helper function to run iterative root finding algorithsm such as Newton's method.
